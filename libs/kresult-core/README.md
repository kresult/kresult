# Module kresult-core

The core module contains all basic definitions and functionality, commonly used in KResult. Virtually all other modules
depend on this either implicitly or explicitly.

# Package io.kresult.core

The core package hosts the main entrypoint of the library: The **[KResult]** class. It provides builders, transformers and 
extractors for result values and failures.
